# What is a Moving Average Crossover?
A Moving Average Crossover is a popular technical analysis strategy used by traders to identity potential buy and sell signals in the stock market. It involves plotting two moving averages of a stock's price:

- Short-Term SMA: Calculates the average closing price over a short period (e.g 5 days).
- Long-Term SMA: Calculates the average closing price over a longer period (e.g 20 days). 

When the short-term SMA crosses above the long-term SMA a buy signal will be created and vice versa for a sell signal.
